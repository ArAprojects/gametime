<h1>Jeopardy!: A Mario-Themed Adaptation of the "Jeopardy" Game Show</h1>

<h3>Created By: Alek Aker, Ann Cerveny, Ayla Dharamsey, Emily Lalonde</h3>

Gametime is an application aimed at improving students skills in OOP, SRP, Testing, and Design. Our group was tasked with creating Jeopardy which is a game played by 3 users where they encounter trivia questions and gain/lose points based on their answers. The game consists of 3 rounds and a winner is determined after the final question is answered in round 3.

<h3>Languages, Libraries, and Applications Used:</h3>
HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Webpack, Fetch API, Mocha Testing Framework, Chai Assertion Library

<h3>Setup</h3>

Should you be interested in running this project on your local machine, please do the following:

1. Clone down the repository using the `git clone` command.
2. Change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the start page to our game. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
